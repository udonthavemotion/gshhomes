### **The Frenchman** - Cavalier (1 model - Medium Priority)

**Issue:** Model not found on Cavalier manufacturer website

**Model Details:**
- **The Frenchman** (3 bed / 2 bath / 16' x 80')
- **Status:** In-Stock and Ready to Tour
- **What was tried:** Searched cavalieralabama.com models page, used site search, checked all single-wide models
- **Finding:** Model name "The Frenchman" not found on Cavalier Alabama website. Web search suggests this may be a model from a different manufacturer (possibly Skyline/Champion Homes)
- **Closest candidate:** https://cavalieralabama.com/ (general models page)
- **Recommendation:** Verify with Gulf South Homes that "The Frenchman" is indeed a Cavalier model, or if it's from a different manufacturer. May be a discontinued or regional-specific model name.

### **Patriot Homes Models** (3 models - Low Priority - Workaround Used)

**Issue:** Patriot Homes does not have a public-facing manufacturer website with model galleries

**Models:**
1. **The Move One Up** (3 bed / 2 bath / 16' x 76')
2. **The Baby Boujee** (3 bed / 2 bath / 16' x 76')
3. **The Washington** (3 bed / 2 bath / 28' x 56')

**What was tried:** Searched for official Patriot Homes website, checked various dealer sites

**Workaround Used:** 
- The Move One Up & The Baby Boujee: Used Gulf South Homes' own gallery pages as these contain official photos
- The Washington: Found on authorized dealer site (Amega Sales) with photo gallery

**Recommendation:** These workarounds are acceptable, but if official manufacturer brochures or spec sheets are available, those would be preferred

3. **Optional:** Obtain official Patriot Homes marketing materials if available, though current workaround URLs are functional

4. **Verification:** Cross-check all specifications (beds/baths/dimensions) between Gulf South listings and manufacturer pages to ensure accuracy
