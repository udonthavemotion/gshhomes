Website Navigation Structure – Update Direction

This update is focused on improving clarity and flow for buyers, especially first-time manufactured home buyers. The goal is to match how customers naturally think and browse.

Homes for Sale (Dropdown)

Single Wide Homes

Double Wide Homes

Modular Homes

Manufacturers

Manufacturers should no longer be a top-level navigation item. It should live under Homes for Sale for buyers who prefer to browse by brand.

What We Offer (Dropdown)

Current Deals & Specials

Financing Options

Land & Home Packages

LA Restore Program

Insurance Assistance

Service Department

Existing Deals and Financing tabs should be removed from the main navigation and consolidated here. This section should be positioned as buyer benefits and support services.

How It Works (Page Structure)

Step 1: Choose Your Home

Step 2: Financing & Budget

Step 3: Land & Permits

Step 4: Delivery & Setup

Step 5: Move-In

This page should clearly explain the buying process in simple, sequential steps. It can be built as a single scrolling page with anchored sections or broken into clear visual blocks.

Overall Goal

Create a clean, buyer-focused navigation that follows a natural decision path:

Browse Homes → Understand Affordability → Learn the Process
