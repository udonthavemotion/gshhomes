current Whenever we scroll down to continue viewing the site from the home page and basically any other page from the larger menu nav implementation to the shortened implementation of that menu nav, we kind of get a break in immersion because the menu nav drops down and centers to the left instead of dropping down and staying exactly where it was but becoming a shortened edition of it.If that makes any sense can we please center the shortened menu nav to be aligned with the larger menu nav so it doesn't break immersion?
