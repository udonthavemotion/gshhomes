Yeah that X take is real. When people who actually build UI for a living spot a “vibecoded” site, it’s usually not because the code is “wrong” — it’s because the **visual system** is missing. Here are the tells, in plain English, that separate “looks like a template/AI” from “someone cooked here.”

## The dead giveaways (non-coders / vibecoders usually miss these)

### 1) Spacing rhythm is random

Real builders pick a spacing scale and stick to it.

* Vibecode look: padding/margins are like `13px, 27px, 19px` everywhere, sections feel “almost aligned.”
* Pro look: spacing is consistent (think 8px grid: 8/16/24/32/48/64).

**Fix:** pick ONE scale and force everything to it.

### 2) Typography has no hierarchy (or too many styles)

* Vibecode look: 4–6 different font sizes for body-ish text, headings don’t “step up,” line-height changes randomly.
* Pro look: a tight type ladder (ex: H1/H2/H3 + body + small) with consistent line-height and letter-spacing rules.

**Fix:** define a type scale and never freestyle sizes inside components.

### 3) Alignment is “close enough”

Humans who ship UIs are obsessive about alignment.

* Vibecode look: text blocks don’t share a baseline, buttons don’t line up with headings, icons float.
* Pro look: everything snaps to a grid; edges and baselines line up.

**Fix:** use a consistent container width + consistent left edges + consistent vertical spacing.

### 4) Inconsistent component rules

* Vibecode look: three different button styles, four border radii, mixed shadows, cards all slightly different.
* Pro look: one button system, one card system, consistent radii + shadows.

**Fix:** make a mini “design system”: `radius`, `shadow`, `border`, `button sizes`, `input sizes`.

### 5) “Too much going on” per section

* Vibecode look: every section tries to be a hero section (gradients, animations, big images, multiple CTAs).
* Pro look: one focal point per section, strong negative space.

**Fix:** cut 30% of decorative elements; let spacing do the flexing.

### 6) Bad line-length + weak readability

Huge tell.

* Vibecode look: paragraphs spanning the full screen width, cramped line-height, low contrast gray on gray.
* Pro look: readable line length (~55–75 characters) and predictable line-height.

**Fix:** cap text blocks (max-width), increase line-height, improve contrast.

### 7) Responsive feels “shrunk” instead of “designed”

* Vibecode look: desktop layout just collapses; text becomes tiny; padding disappears; sections feel stacked and chaotic.
* Pro look: intentional mobile typography + spacing + simplified layouts.

**Fix:** mobile gets its own type sizes and spacing rules, not just `flex-col`.

### 8) Asset quality mismatch

* Vibecode look: random stock photos, inconsistent color temperature, mixed aspect ratios, fuzzy logos.
* Pro look: consistent imagery style and consistent cropping rules.

**Fix:** define image rules (aspect ratios, rounding, compression, consistent tone).

### 9) Micro-interactions are either missing or obnoxious

* Vibecode look: no hover/focus states OR everything bounces/spins.
* Pro look: subtle hover, clear focus states, smooth transitions (150–250ms), consistent easing.

**Fix:** add boring-but-clean states everywhere.

### 10) Accessibility tells (pros notice instantly)

* Vibecode look: focus rings missing, buttons without clear states, low contrast, headings out of order.
* Pro look: keyboard friendly, visible focus, correct semantic structure.

**Fix:** never remove focus; make it match brand instead.

## The “pro vibe” checklist (if you nail these you’ll look legit fast)

* One spacing scale (8px system) across the entire site
* One typography scale (H1/H2/H3/body/small)
* One container width + consistent section padding (ex: 80–120px desktop, 48–64px mobile)
* Consistent radii and shadows (don’t freestyle)
* Clear hierarchy: one primary CTA per page/section
* Text max width for readability
* Responsive redesign, not just collapse
* Consistent image treatment
* Hover/focus states everywhere

---

## Quick practical move for your vibecoded sites

Make your agents follow a **hard design system contract**:

**“No arbitrary values.”**
Only use:

* spacing: `8,16,24,32,48,64,96`
* font sizes: `14,16,18,24,32,48` (or similar)
* radius: `12` and `24` only
* shadow: `sm, md, lg` only

That one rule alone eliminates like 70% of the “AI site” look.

If you want to go nuclear on this: the #1 glow-up is **locking your spacing + typography into tokens** and forcing every component to use them. That’s the difference between “it works” and “it feels expensive.”



PROMPT TO FIX - 
Design System Consistency Implementation Prompt
Objective
Apply consistent design tokens across the site to improve visual consistency and polish. This is a polish pass, not a redesign. Preserve all existing functionality, brand colors, fonts, content, and general layouts.
Critical constraints (do not change)
Brand identity
Keep all brand colors (CSS variables in index.css)
Keep all fonts (Outfit + Plus Jakarta Sans)
Keep logo usage and placement
Functionality
Do not break existing features
Do not change component logic or behavior
Do not modify routing or navigation structure
Do not alter form submissions or API calls
Content and layout
Do not change copy or content
Do not restructure page layouts
Do not move sections or components
Do not change image/video sources or sizes
Visual hierarchy
Do not change color contrast ratios
Do not alter visual weight of elements
Do not change z-index or stacking contexts
What to change (token standardization only)
Phase 1: Foundation tokens (low risk)
Spacing scale standardization
Current: Mixed spacing values (some arbitrary px)
Target: Use only these values: 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px
Method:
Audit components for px-[, py-[, gap-[, space-y-[ with arbitrary values
Replace with nearest token value
Example: px-[13px] → px-3 (12px) or px-4 (16px)
Risk: Low — visual spacing may shift slightly but layout remains intact
Border radius standardization
Current: Using rounded-md (6px), rounded-lg (8px), rounded-xl (12px), rounded-2xl (16px)
Target: Use only 12px and 24px
Method:
Replace rounded-md and rounded-lg with rounded-[12px]
Replace rounded-xl with rounded-[12px] (if currently 12px)
Replace rounded-2xl with rounded-[24px] (for larger cards/sections)
Risk: Low — subtle visual change, no layout impact
Transition duration standardization
Current: Mixed durations (200ms, 300ms, 500ms, 700ms)
Target: Use only 150ms, 200ms, 250ms
Method:
Replace duration-300 with duration-200
Replace duration-500 and duration-700 with duration-200 or duration-[250ms]
Risk: Very low — animations may feel slightly faster/smoother
Phase 2: Typography refinement (medium risk)
Typography scale alignment
Current: Typography scale exists but may not match exact requirements
Target:
H1: 48-56px desktop / 34-40px mobile
H2: 32-40px desktop / 26-32px mobile
H3: 24-28px
Body: 16-18px
Small: 14px
Method:
Update tailwind.config.js fontSize definitions
Replace direct text-[ values with typography tokens
Test on mobile to ensure readability
Risk: Medium — test thoroughly, especially mobile
Line height consistency
Current: May vary
Target: Headings 1.1-1.2, body 1.5-1.7
Method: Add leading-tight (1.25) to headings, leading-relaxed (1.625) to body
Risk: Low — improves readability
Phase 3: Layout consistency (low-medium risk)
Container max-width standardization
Current: Container max-width may be 1440px
Target: 1100-1200px max
Method:
Update tailwind.config.js container 2xl breakpoint to 1200px
Or add max-w-[1200px] utility class
Risk: Low — content may feel slightly narrower, test on large screens
Section padding standardization
Current: Mixed (py-20, py-28, py-12, etc.)
Target: py-12 or py-16 mobile, py-24 (96px) desktop
Method:
Create pattern: py-12 md:py-24 or py-16 md:py-24
Apply consistently across all page sections
Risk: Low — spacing may shift slightly, test vertical rhythm
Phase 4: Hero text readability (low risk)
Hero text overlay method
Current: May use heavy text shadows for readability
Target: White text + subtle dark gradient overlay
Method:
Remove heavy textShadow inline styles from hero text
Add gradient overlay div: <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent via-black/40 to-black/80" />
Ensure text remains readable
Risk: Low — improves readability, test contrast
Implementation strategy
Step 1: Audit phase (1-2 days)
Create a spreadsheet tracking:
All components using arbitrary spacing
All border radius values used
All transition durations
All typography sizes
All section padding values
Prioritize by frequency (most common first)
Step 2: Token foundation (1 day)
Update tailwind.config.js with standardized tokens
Add CSS variables in index.css for consistency
Test that existing styles still work
Step 3: Component-by-component (2-3 days)
Start with most-used components (Button, Navbar, Footer)
Test each component after changes
Move to less-used components
Document any visual changes
Step 4: Page-by-page (3-5 days)
Start with Home page (most visible)
Test on mobile and desktop
Move to other pages systematically
Check for visual regressions
Step 5: Final polish (1 day)
Global search for remaining arbitrary values
Final visual review
Documentation update
Testing requirements
Before marking complete:
Visual regression testing
Compare before/after screenshots
Check mobile and desktop
Verify no layout breaks
Functional testing
All buttons work
All forms submit
Navigation works
No console errors
Performance testing
No performance degradation
Animations remain smooth
Accessibility testing
Focus states still visible
Contrast ratios maintained
Screen reader compatibility
Success criteria
The implementation is successful when:
[ ] All spacing uses tokens (8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)
[ ] All border radius is 12px or 24px only
[ ] All transitions are 150-250ms
[ ] Typography uses standardized scale
[ ] Section padding is consistent (96px desktop, 48-64px mobile)
[ ] Container max-width is 1100-1200px
[ ] Hero text uses gradient overlay (not heavy shadows)
[ ] No visual regressions (screenshots match before/after)
[ ] No functional regressions (everything works)
[ ] Build passes without errors
[ ] Console is clean (no warnings/errors)
[ ] Mobile and desktop tested
Risk mitigation
Use feature branches
One branch per phase
Test before merging
Incremental changes
Change one component type at a time
Test after each change
Visual regression tools
Use tools like Percy or Chromatic if available
Or manual screenshot comparison
Rollback plan
Keep old values commented for quick rollback
Document what changed where
Communication
Daily standup updates
What changed yesterday
What's changing today
Any blockers or concerns
Visual change log
Document any intentional visual changes
Note any unexpected side effects
Questions protocol
If unsure about a change, ask before implementing
Better to ask than break something
Final notes
This is a polish pass, not a redesign. The goal is consistency, not visual change. If a change feels like it's changing the design too much, it probably is. When in doubt, preserve the existing look and feel.
Focus on:
Consistency over perfection
Safety over speed
Incremental progress over big changes
Testing over assuming
The site should feel more cohesive and professional after this work, without users noticing a major redesign. It should feel "more polished" rather than "completely different."
