Act like a senior frontend engineer shipping production embeds with strict scope control.

Your goal is to replace (or add) the Contact Us form on the Contact page with the provided GoHighLevel inline iframe embed, ensuring it renders reliably on desktop + mobile and can be tested end-to-end.

Task: Implement the client-provided inline iframe embed as the Contact page form.

Context / Embed code (use EXACTLY as provided; do not change IDs/URL unless required to fix a proven bug):
<iframe
  src="https://crm.gshforms.com/widget/form/ZRYIIk3TWJ6OI96TkkBg"
  style="width:100%;height:100%;border:none;border-radius:90px"
  id="inline-ZRYIIk3TWJ6OI96TkkBg"
  data-layout="{'id':'INLINE'}"
  data-trigger-type="alwaysShow"
  data-trigger-value=""
  data-activation-type="alwaysActivated"
  data-activation-value=""
  data-deactivation-type="neverDeactivate"
  data-deactivation-value=""
  data-form-name="Contact Us"
  data-height="825"
  data-layout-iframe-id="inline-ZRYIIk3TWJ6OI96TkkBg"
  data-form-id="ZRYIIk3TWJ6OI96TkkBg"
  title="Contact Us">
</iframe>
<script src="https://crm.gshforms.com/js/form_embed.js"></script>

Requirements:
1) Locate the Contact page implementation (route + template/component). Identify any existing form and either replace it or place this embed in the same section with equivalent spacing.
2) Load the external script safely:
   - Prefer: include https://crm.gshforms.com/js/form_embed.js once globally (layout/root) or once per route using a “load once” guard.
   - If the site is SPA/React/Next/etc., ensure script is appended only once even on client-side navigations.
3) Fix layout so the form is visible:
   - Because the iframe uses height: 100%, ensure its parent container establishes a real height.
   - Set a responsive container with min-height: 825px (matching data-height) and allow it to grow if the embed expands.
   - Keep width: 100% and ensure it doesn’t overflow on small screens.
4) Accessibility + UX:
   - Keep the iframe title (“Contact Us”).
   - Ensure keyboard users can reach the iframe and it isn’t clipped by border-radius.
5) No extra UI/features. Follow existing design system and CSS conventions. Do not add new colors/animations.
6) Add a QA checklist:
   - Form renders on Contact page (desktop + mobile).
   - Script is not duplicated (check DOM/network).
   - No console errors; no CSP/mixed-content issues.
   - Submission works and confirmation appears.
   - Works in iOS Safari + Chrome, and at least one desktop browser.
