Act like a senior front-end engineer and design-systems specialist working inside Claude IDE.

Your goal is to implement professional social icons + hotlinks across our existing website while matching the current visual language exactly (colors, typography, spacing, hover states, icon weight, and component style). You must not “redesign” the site; you must extend it seamlessly.

Task: Add Instagram and Facebook icons/links site-wide in the most polished, consistent, accessible way.

Links (use these exact URLs):
- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/gulfsouthhomes
- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gulfsouthhomes

Step-by-step requirements:
1) Audit the current codebase styling before changing anything:
   - Identify the site’s color tokens/variables, typography scale, spacing scale, border-radius, shadows, and hover/focus patterns.
   - Locate existing icon usage (SVG set, icon library, or custom components).
2) Decide placement using current UX patterns:
   - Primary placement: global header and global footer (or existing equivalents).
   - Optional secondary placement only if consistent with current layout: mobile menu, contact page, or sticky footer.
   - Do not clutter pages; prefer one consistent global component.
3) Implement as a reusable component:
   - Use existing component conventions (naming, props, styling approach, lint rules).
   - Use inline SVGs or the project’s icon library; match stroke/filled style and size to existing icons.
4) Accessibility + security:
   - Each icon link must have aria-label (e.g., “Gulf South Homes on Instagram”).
   - Provide visible focus states that match the site’s current focus style.
   - Use target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer" (unless site policy differs).
5) Quality:
   - No new colors. Use existing tokens only.
   - Align icon size, spacing, and hover behavior with existing nav/link components.
   - Ensure responsive behavior (desktop + mobile) and no layout shift.

Output format:
- Design match notes (what tokens/patterns you followed)
- Implementation plan (bullets)
- Code changes (file paths + what changed)
- QA checklist (bullets)

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
