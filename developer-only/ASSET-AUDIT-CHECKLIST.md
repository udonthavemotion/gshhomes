## 🔴 CRITICAL: Missing Images That Hurt Authenticity

These are the **most important** items that make your site feel "template-y" or generic instead of feeling like YOUR business.

### 1. Showroom & Lot Photos (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why it matters:** Visitors want to see your actual business, not just homes

| Status | Description | Suggested Shot | Where It's Used |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ⬜ | Exterior of Gulf South Homes building | Wide shot showing sign, building, lot | Contact page, About page, Footer |
| ⬜ | Aerial/drone shot of lot with homes displayed | Bird's eye view of inventory on lot | Homepage hero alternative |
| ⬜ | Front entrance with "Welcome" feel | Door, parking, signage | Contact page, directions |
| ⬜ | Interior of sales office | Where customers meet with staff | About page |
| ⬜ | Parts store interior (shelves, inventory) | Show actual product variety | Parts page |
| ⬜ | Parts store counter/checkout area | Customer service area | Parts page |

### 2. Staff Action Shots (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 5. Customer Testimonial Photos (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

## 🚨 What Makes the Site Feel "Unauthentic" Right Now

### Things That Scream "Template Website"

1. **Generic Icons Instead of Photos**
   - How It Works: Big boxes with icons, no real images
   - Insurance page: All icons, zero photos
   - LA Restore: Gradient backgrounds, no photos

2. **Missing "Real Business" Photos**
   - No photos of your actual building/lot
   - No photos of staff working with customers
   - No photos of the delivery/setup process

3. **Testimonials Use Initials**
   - Shows "SJ" instead of Sarah Jenkins' photo
   - Feels generated, not real

4. **No "Action" Photography**
   - Everything looks posed or is an icon
   - No one is shown actually doing work

5. **Borrowed/Generic Images**
   - Some sections reuse the same gallery photos
   - Parts store photos look staged

### Quick Fixes That Make Big Impact

1. ⭐ **Get 5-10 showroom/lot photos** → Instantly makes site feel "yours"
2. ⭐ **Capture 3-5 delivery/setup moments** → Shows you actually do this
3. ⭐ **Get customer testimonial photos** → Transforms social proof section
4. ⭐ **Staff candid/action shots** → Humanizes the brand

## 📱 Photo Tips for Non-Professionals

You don't need a professional photographer. Modern phones work great!

### Lighting
- **Best time:** Overcast days or early morning (no harsh shadows)
- **Interior:** Turn on all lights, open blinds
- **Avoid:** Noon sun, backlit subjects

### Composition
- **Rule of thirds:** Don't center everything
- **Include people when possible:** Even partially in frame
- **Multiple angles:** Take 5-10 versions of each shot

### What to Capture
- **Candid > Posed:** Natural moments beat lineup photos
- **Action shots:** People doing things, not looking at camera
- **Details + Wide:** Get both close-ups and full scenes

### Technical
- **Clean the lens:** Seriously, wipe your phone camera
- **Horizontal for web:** Most web images work better landscape
- **High resolution:** Don't crop in-camera, crop later
