## For Client Review

### What We're Testing
We've created 4 new color schemes based on your feedback about moving away from green. Each uses:
- **Blue** for structure, navigation, and trust
- **Red** for action buttons (CTAs) only
- **White/Gray** for clean, professional backgrounds

### How to Test

#### Step 1: Open the Theme Tester
1. Look for the palette icon (🎨) in the bottom-right corner
2. Click it to open the theme panel
3. You'll see 5 options:
   - Current Green (your current site)
   - Corporate Trust
   - Gulf Coast Modern
   - American Classic
   - Coastal Premium

#### Step 2: Switch Between Themes
- Click any theme name to instantly change the entire site
- No page refresh needed—changes happen instantly
- Navigate to different pages to see how the theme applies everywhere

#### Step 3: What to Look For

**Homepage:**
- Does the hero section feel impactful?
- Do the "View Homes For Sale" buttons stand out?
- Does the navigation feel professional?
- Does the award section look premium?

**Catalog Pages:**
- Are the home cards easy to scan?
- Do prices and CTAs stand out?
- Is it easy to find what you're looking for?

**Overall Feel:**
- Professional vs. approachable
- Modern vs. traditional
- Warm vs. authoritative

#### Step 4: Test on Mobile
- Open the site on your phone
- Use the theme switcher (it works on mobile too!)
- Check that buttons are easy to tap
- Ensure text is readable

## Common Questions

**Q: Can we mix colors from different palettes?**
A: Not recommended. Each palette is designed to work together. Mixing can break visual hierarchy.

**Q: Can we adjust a color slightly?**
A: Yes! Once you choose a palette, we can fine-tune specific shades.

**Q: What about our logo?**
A: Your logo will work with all palettes. We can adjust if needed.

**Q: Will this affect our existing customers?**
A: It's just a visual refresh. All functionality stays the same.

**Q: How long to implement the chosen theme?**
A: About 30 minutes once you decide. We'll make it the default and remove the switcher.
